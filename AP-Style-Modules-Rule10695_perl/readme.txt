This Perl module is designed to be used by the larger language processing system that edits XML files.

This rule finds the 'callouts' for each item in the bibliography and changes the format of the callout depending on it's order, location within the document, and number of authors in the bibliographic entry.

The module does not use regular xml tools (such as LibXML) due to business specific implementation criteria.
