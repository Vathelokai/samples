			<p>The toon labor contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="example-mouse1">Mouse, Duck, Pig, Bird, and Warner 2009</xref>) was negotiated between TAG (Toon Actor&apos;s Guild) and DIP, Inc., representing the various animation studios.</p>
			<p>Hanna Barbera Studios was the only major studio to resist the pressure from the TAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="example-Flintstones1">Fred and Barney 2010</xref>. Pixar Animation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="example-Apple1">Jobs 2010</xref>) was included in the contract as part of the Disney conglomerate.</p>
			<p>Because of the differing labor laws, Japanese firms were able to negotiate separate agreements with individual Toons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="example-pioneer1">Muyo, Lain, and Dual 2015</xref>).</p>
			<p>While research does show significant correlations between general cognitive ability and Ability EI, a meta-analysis has shown that, in some cases, Ability EI does have predictive value after controlling for IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="iace-00-01-03-VanRooy1">Van Rooy and Viswesvaran 2004</xref>).</p>
			<p>Beta Alpha Psi is a national fraternity for business professionals and students. The purposes of this organization are to recognize &ldquo;outstanding academic achievements in the field of accounting, finance and information systems; promote the study and practice of professional fields related to these disciplines; provide opportunities for self-development and association among members and practicing financial professionals; and encourage a sense of ethical, social, and public responsibilities&rdquo; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="iace-00-01-04-BetaAlphaPsi1">Beta Alpha Psi 2006</xref>). As the premier professional accounting and financial information fraternity, Beta Alpha Psi complements its members&apos; formal education by providing interaction among students, faculty, and professionals, while fostering lifelong growth and ethical conduct. Identifying future accountants with advanced moral development through Beta Alpha Psi membership can play a critical role in addressing ethics issues confronting the accounting profession. Additionally, Beta Alpha Psi promotes prosocial behavior by requiring its members to regularly participate in public service activities (e.g., Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, tutoring) through some form of volunteerism (as opposed to <italic>voluntary</italic> volunteerism)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="n4"><sup>4</sup></xref><fn id="n4"><label><sup>4</sup><x>&thinsp;</x></label><p>Specific requirements for Beta Alpha Psi membership may vary from school to school (e.g., GPA level), yet all chapters require at least a minimum GPA of 3.0 and regular performance of volunteerism for a member to be in good standing.</p>
			<p>Our past work revealed that spatial integration of first-order motion signals exhibits dramatic dependence on stimulus visibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin3">Tadin, Lappin, Gilroy, &amp; Blake, 2003</xref>). At low contrasts, motion perception is characterized by spatial summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Anderson1">Anderson &amp; Burr 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Watson2">Watson &amp; Turano 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin3">Tadin et al. 2003</xref>), i.e., increasing sensitivity with increasing size. At high contrasts, however, motion direction becomes increasingly harder to perceive as the stimulus size increases&mdash;a result described as spatial suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin3">Tadin et al. 2003</xref>; Tadin &amp; Lapin, 2005a). This pattern of results has been linked to spatial interactions in cortical area MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin2">Tadin &amp; Lappin 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin5">Tadin, Silvanto, Pascual-Leone, &amp; Battelli, 2011</xref>) and has been observed in the activity of single units in macaque MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Pack1">Pack, Hunter, and Born, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Churan1">Churan, Khawaja, Tsui, &amp; Pack, 2008</xref>). Both psychophysical and neurophysiological results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Born2">Born et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin2">Tadin &amp; Lappin 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin4">Tadin, Paffen, Blake, &amp; Lappin, 2008</xref>) suggest that spatial suppression may play a role in motion segregation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Braddick1">Braddick 1993</xref>). Turning to second-order motion, it is unknown whether motion perception of second-order stimuli exhibits analogous interactive dependence on stimulus size and visibility. Previous work showed that second-order motion is a poor cue for motion segregation processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Derrington1">Derrington &amp; Badcock 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Dosher1">Dosher, Landy, &amp; Sperling, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Nishida2">Nishida, Edwards &amp; Sato, 1997</xref>). Given a presumed link between spatial suppression and motion segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Born2">Born et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin2">Tadin &amp; Lappin 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="test-00-00-00-Tadin4">Tadin et al. 2008</xref>), this led us to hypothesize that second-order processes might not exhibit strong spatial suppression found for first-order motion.</p>
